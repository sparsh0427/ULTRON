# ULTRON

•With the advent of sensing technology, the security and assistance needed in our daily life is greatly enhanced by highly sophisticated sensors. Sensing systems not only secure our important protocols but also provide real time assistance. This project focuses on advancing technologies and also making human work easier. Using remote or a specific device to control computer makes it tedious task , so as to make it more easier we are using hand gestures to control basic computer functions.

### Advancements in Technology is not a luxury, it is a necessity.

## MAKING TASKS EASIER
Instead of using a keyboard, mouse, remote or joystick, we can use our hand gestures to control certain functions of a computer like to play/pause , Forward/Rewind , volume UP/DOWN of a video. Also this project is very easy to understand . This project is based on the combination of Arduino and python.

## Functionality 
The idea behind the project is quite easy by using two Ultrasonic Sensors with Arduino. We will place the two sensors on the top of a screen and calculate the distance between the hand and the sensor. Counting on the information from Arduino that is sent to Python through the serial port, this information will then be read by Python which is running on the computer in order to perform certain actions.

## Languages and Technologies Used 
### Hardware components: 
Arduino <br />
Two Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) <br /> 
Some wires <br/>
### Software apps:
